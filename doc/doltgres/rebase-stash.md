## dolt_rebase and the dolt.rebase table

`dolt_rebase('-i', upstream)` requires a clean working set and no pending
merge or rebase. It records the commits reachable from HEAD but not from the
upstream (oldest first) as `pick` steps in `pg_catalog.pg_dolt_rebase`, keyed
by the temporary branch `dolt_rebase_<branch>` that it creates at the
upstream commit and switches the session to, and stores the original branch
and upstream in a `rebase/<temporary branch>` manifest ref (object kind
`rebase`). The plan is visible as `dolt.rebase`, `dolt_rebase` and
`schema.dolt_rebase` (`rebase_order float8, action, commit_hash,
commit_message`), updatable through the auto-updatable views; the parser
guard `rebase_table_guard` reports "table not found" whenever the session
branch has no active rebase, as Dolt's working-set table does.

`dolt_rebase('--continue')` validates the plan (ascending order; `squash`
and `fixup` must follow a `pick` or `reword`; `edit` is not supported) and
applies it on the temporary branch with the cherry-pick machinery
(`install_database` of parent → commit onto the current head): `pick`
re-commits with the original message and author, `reword` uses the plan's
message, `drop` skips, `fixup` amends the previous commit, `squash` amends
it joining both messages with a blank line. Steps that become empty are
dropped. A conflicting step raises "data conflict detected while rebasing
commit …"; resolve by aborting (there is no conflict pause). On success the
original branch's refs move to the rebased head, its live tables are
restored from that state (`restore_table_on`), the session returns to it,
and the temporary branch and plan are deleted. `--abort` returns to the
original branch unchanged. Results are `(status, message)` records with
Dolt's wording.

## dolt_stash and dolt.stashes

`dolt_stash(push|pop|apply|drop|clear, name [, index])`. `push` captures the
working set, stores a `stash` object (children: stashed working database,
staged database, head commit; payload with branch, head and the `WIP on
<branch>: <hash7> <message>` text) under `stash/<name>/<seq>`, and restores
the tracked tables to HEAD. Only tracked tables are stashed; untracked
tables stay in place. `pop`/`apply` merge the stash three-way onto the
current working set (base: the stash's head) and error with Dolt's "would be
overwritten" message on conflicts; `pop` and `drop` remove the entry,
`clear` removes every entry of a name. `dolt.stashes` / `dolt_stashes` list
`name, stash_id (stash@{n}, newest first), branch, hash, commit_message`.

## dolt_query_diff

Both query strings are analyzed at parse time (`query_diff_layout`) so the
result has `from_<col>…, to_<col>…, diff_type`. Rows are compared as whole
values after running both queries with the caller's search path: rows only
in the first result are `deleted`, rows only in the second are `added`, and
identical rows are omitted. Dolt's primary-key based `modified` rows are not
produced.

## dolt.help

`dolt_help()` returns a static catalog (`name, type, synopsis,
short_description, long_description, arguments json`) of the implemented
procedures and functions, exposed as `dolt.help` / `dolt_help`.

## dolt.tests and dolt_test_run

`pg_catalog.pg_dolt_test` (unversioned, like `dolt_docs`) backs `dolt.tests`
/ `dolt_tests` with Dolt's columns and check constraints on assertion types
(`expected_rows`, `expected_columns`, `expected_single_value`) and
comparators. `dolt_test_run([name | group | '*'])` runs each query read-only
in a subtransaction with the caller's search path and reports `PASS`/`FAIL`
with Dolt's messages ("Assertion failed: …", "Query error: …",
"expected_single_value expects exactly one cell …"); numeric values compare
numerically, others as text. An unknown selector errors with "could not find
tests for argument".

Tests: `src/test/modules/test_prolly/t/024_rebase_stash.pl`; Doltgres
